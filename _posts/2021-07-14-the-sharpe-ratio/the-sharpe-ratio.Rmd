# 1. Overview

In the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.

In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.

On January 23, 2014, multiple events unfolded in Abila. Youâ€™ve been asked to come in to perform a retrospective analysis based on limited information about what took place. Your goal is to identify risks and how they could have been mitigated more effectively.

in this assignment we would provide some insights to help law enforcement from Kronos and Tethys.


# 2. Exploration and preparation of Data

(1) Microblog records that have been identified by automated filters as being potentially relevant to the ongoing incident

(2) Text transcripts of emergency dispatches by the Abila, Kronos local police and fire departments.

Two dataset are stored in 3 csv files, they are csv-1700-1830.csv", "csv-1831-2000.csv' and  "csv-2001-2131.csv":

The data for Mini-Challenge 3 is found in three segments.

Segment 1 covers the time period from 1700 to 1830 Abila time on January 23. 

Segment 2 covers the time period from 1830 to 2000 Abila time on January 23.
