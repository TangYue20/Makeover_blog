In this DataViz Makeover, I have used data  [*Merchandise Trade by Region/Market*](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data) provided by Department of Statistics Singapore(DOS).

# 1. Critique and Suggestions for Current Visualisation
The original visualization can be seen below. 

![](image/1.original chart.png){width=70%}

## 1.1 Clarity

1. The overlapped bubble results in readers having difficulties to estimate the total merchandise trade values for some countries such as Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, which would be hard for readers to precisely identify the ''Net Importers' and 'Net Exporters'.

2. The difference between merchandise import and export for some countries with Singapore are quite small, the bubbles of this kind of countries are just on the separation line such as Japan, Unite State, which makes it hard to identify the countries' import exceeds its export or export exceeds its import.


3. The unite of x axis and y axis are not indicated, which could confuse  viewers the unite of import and export are billion or million.  

4. The size of bubble charts reflects the total merchandise trade values across all countries, but it do not give the viewer a way to quickly and accurately identify the difference of the export and import trade volume.

5. No source data included. including source data at bottom of visualization would helpful to increase data reliability. 


## 1.2 Aesthetics

1. The color used for differentiate 'Net Importers' and 'Net Exporters' are not distinct, which cannot makes readers quickly clarify two groups of different relationship of import and export values.

2. The image are not necessary as it does not enhance the conveyance of information.

3. The chart looks too crowed and the label are very big, which would add reading difficulties for users.


# 2. Alternative Design
The alternative design is as follows.

![](image/72.scipts.jpg){width=90%}

## 2.1 Advantages of proposed design
### Clarity

1. Title and subtitle explain key information and finding which would be used in chart, helping for readers' understanding. 

2. Y-axis and x-axis are added with unit, enabling reader easily understand the import and export volume across different years and countries.

3. Dumbbell chart clearly show the difference of import and export for Singapore merchandise with one country, which also make it possible to compare export and import vertically and horizontally.

4. Use percentile to show the distribution of import and export for Singapore merchandise trade with major countries, which spread bubbles of countries into quadrant ' High Import and High Export', ' High Import and Low Export', ' High Export and Low Import, Low Export and Low Import',  then countries would distinctly show their trade situation with Singapore.

5. Add the data source to describe the dataset used.

6. Add the Ranking of Import, Export and Total Trade Volume helps users better identify the distribution of import and export of Singapore merchandise trade across major partners. 


### Aesthetic

1. There are 4 distinct colors for 4 quadrant, which used in chart to identify four group of countries which have different import and export volume with Singapore. 

2. Use percentile to show the distribution of import and export for Singapore merchandise trade with major countries, which avoid the overlap of bubbles on the chart

3. Annotations are used to emphasize key observations,helping users quickly clarify the relationship between import and export for Singapore merchandise trade with one country.


# 3. Final Visualisation

![](image/0.1 final dashboard.png){width=90%}

The final look of the data visualization makeover is shown in Figure 4. It is also available in [*Tableau Public*](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yue.tang/viz/DataDiz_Makeover3/Dashboard1)


# 4.0 Data visualisation steps

## 4.1 Data Source
In remaking the existing visualisation, I used

i) Table 1 -- Merchandise Trade --	Merchandise Imports By Region/Market, Monthly
ii) Table 2 --  Merchandise Trade --	Merchandise Exports By Region/Market, Monthly

provided by [*Merchandise Trade by Region/Market*](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data)

## 4.2 Data Cleaning and Preparation
**1. Data Cleaning with Excel**

1. Transpose data

Click T1 sheet > Select the entire table > create a new sheet
![](image/4. copy table.png){width=90%}

* click a empty cell > right click and select 'Transpose'.

![](image/2.transform data.png){width=30%}

* Rename the new sheet as 'Import'. Repeat the transposing operation for T2 and rename as 'Export'

![](image/3.rename table.png){width=80%}

*  because study period is between January 2011-December 2020.Delete our target data is from January 1967 to  December 2020.
